# auto-softlink
A tool to automatically softlink multiple files to different folders on the filesystem. Especially useful for ML model weights.


## TODO:

- [ ] Add a safe docker based test environment 
- [ ] Add support for watching a tree of files
- [ ] Add automatic build for MacOS, Linux and Windows
- [ ] Add distribution for MacOS, Linux and Windows package managers
- [ ] Add safety switches - max files, existence of external files in the target dirs
- [ ] Add support for star mode - where all folders are both source and target
